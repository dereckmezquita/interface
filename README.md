## Overview

The `interface` package brings the power of interfaces and runtime type
checking to R, offering a robust solution for data structure validation
and enhancing code reliability. In the dynamic world of R programming,
where data structures can be fluid, `interface` provides a safety net,
ensuring that your data conforms to expected structures and types.

### Why `interface`?

1.  **Data Integrity**: Ensure your data structures are consistent and
    valid throughout your analysis pipeline.
2.  **Early Error Detection**: Catch type mismatches and structural
    issues at runtime, preventing silent errors that could compromise
    your results.
3.  **Self-Documenting Code**: Interfaces serve as clear contracts,
    making your code more readable and self-explanatory.
4.  **Flexible Validation**: From simple type checks to complex custom
    validations, `interface` adapts to your needs.
5.  **Performance Control**: Toggle validation on/off as needed,
    balancing safety and performance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of interface from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("dereckmezquita/interface")
```

## Quick Start

``` r
box::use(interface[interface, implement])

# Define an interface for a data structure
PersonData <- interface("PersonData",
    name = "character",
    age = "numeric",
    email = "character",
    scores = "data.frame"
)

# Implement the interface
john_data <- implement(PersonData,
    name = "John Doe",
    age = 30,
    email = "john@example.com",
    scores = data.frame(subject = c("Math", "Science"), score = c(95, 88))
)

# Access data safely
print(john_data$name)
#> [1] "John Doe"
```

``` r
print(john_data$scores)
#>   subject score
#> 1    Math    95
#> 2 Science    88
```

``` r

# This will raise an error, preventing silent issues
try(john_data$age <- "thirty")
#> Error in `$<-.validated_list`(`*tmp*`, age, value = "thirty") : 
#>   Property 'age' does not match the expected type specification
```

## Detailed Usage

### Basic Interface Definition

Interfaces in R provide a clear contract for data structures:

``` r
# Define a basic interface
SimpleDataset <- interface("SimpleDataset",
    id = "integer",
    value = "numeric",
    category = "factor"
)

# Implement the interface
valid_data <- implement(SimpleDataset,
    id = 1L,
    value = 10.5,
    category = factor("A", levels = c("A", "B", "C"))
)

print(valid_data)
#> Object implementing SimpleDataset interface:
#>   id: 1 
#>   value: 10.5 
#>   category: 1 
#> Validation on access: Enabled
```

### Custom Validation Functions

For more complex validations, use custom functions:

``` r
# Custom validation function
is_valid_email <- function(x) {
    grepl("^[^@\\s]+@[^@\\s]+\\.[^@\\s]+$", x)
}

# Interface with custom validation
UserProfile <- interface("UserProfile",
    username = "character",
    email = is_valid_email,
    age = function(x) is.numeric(x) && x >= 18
)

# Implement with valid data
valid_user <- implement(UserProfile,
    username = "john_doe",
    email = "john@example.com",
    age = 25
)

print(valid_user)
#> Object implementing UserProfile interface:
#>   username: john_doe 
#>   email: john@example.com 
#>   age: 25 
#> Validation on access: Enabled
```

``` r

# This will raise an error due to invalid email
try(implement(UserProfile,
    username = "jane_doe",
    email = "not_an_email",
    age = 30
))
#> Error in validate_object(obj, interface) : 
#>   Property 'email' does not match the expected type specification
```

### Nested Interfaces

Compose complex data structures with nested interfaces:

``` r
Address <- interface("Address",
    street = "character",
    city = "character",
    postal_code = "character"
)

Employee <- interface("Employee",
    name = "character",
    position = "character",
    address = Address
)

employee_data <- implement(Employee,
    name = "Alice Johnson",
    position = "Data Scientist",
    address = implement(Address,
        street = "123 Tech Street",
        city = "Data City",
        postal_code = "12345"
    )
)

print(employee_data$address$city)
#> [1] "Data City"
```

### Flexible Validation Control

Toggle validation for performance optimisation:

``` r
LargeDataset <- interface("LargeDataset",
    data = "data.frame",
    metadata = "list",
    validate_on_access = FALSE # Disable validation for performance
)

big_data <- implement(LargeDataset,
    data = data.frame(x = 1:1000000, y = runif(1000000)),
    metadata = list(source = "simulation", date = Sys.Date())
)

# No validation on access for better performance
big_data$data[1, "x"] <- "should be numeric but no error raised"
```

## Benefits in Real-world Scenarios

### Data Pipeline Integrity

Ensure consistent data structures throughout your analysis pipeline:

``` r
# Define interfaces for each stage of your pipeline
RawData <- interface("RawData",
    timestamp = "POSIXct",
    measurements = "list"
)

ProcessedData <- interface("ProcessedData",
    timestamp = "POSIXct",
    average = "numeric",
    stddev = "numeric"
)

AnalysisResult <- interface("AnalysisResult",
    data = ProcessedData,
    model_fit = "list",
    r_squared = "numeric"
)

# Your pipeline functions
process_data <- function(raw_data) {
    # Processing logic here
    implement(ProcessedData,
        timestamp = raw_data$timestamp,
        average = mean(unlist(raw_data$measurements)),
        stddev = sd(unlist(raw_data$measurements))
    )
}

analyze_data <- function(processed_data) {
    # Analysis logic here
    implement(AnalysisResult,
        data = processed_data,
        model_fit = list(coefficients = c(intercept = 0.5, slope = 1.2)),
        r_squared = 0.85
    )
}

# Run the pipeline
raw_data <- implement(RawData,
    timestamp = Sys.time(),
    measurements = list(10, 15, 20, 18, 22)
)

processed <- process_data(raw_data)
result <- analyze_data(processed)

print(result)
#> Object implementing AnalysisResult interface:
#>   data: <validated_list>
#>   model_fit: <list>
#>   r_squared: 0.85 
#> Validation on access: Enabled
```

This example demonstrates how `interface` can ensure data integrity
throughout a multi-stage analysis pipeline, catching any structural or
type inconsistencies early in the process.
