### Notes on Using `renv` with This R Package

#### Purpose of `renv`

- **Isolate Development Environment**: Keeps the package development isolated from other projects, preventing conflicts.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures the exact same package versions are used by everyone, aiding in consistent development and testing.
- **Manage Development Dependencies**: Handles dependencies required for development, testing, and documentation that are not listed in `DESCRIPTION`.

#### Initial Setup

1. **Initialize `renv`**:

```R
renv::init()
```
This sets up a local project-specific library and creates the necessary `renv` files.

2. **Install Development Dependencies**:

```R
# install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat"))
renv::install(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat"))
renv::snapshot()
```
This records the versions of these packages in `renv.lock`.

#### Regular Workflow

1. **Activate `renv`** (each time you start working on the package):

```R
renv::activate()
```

2. **Install New Dependencies**:

- Install any new packages you need:

```R
install.packages("new_package")
```

- Update the lockfile:

```R
renv::snapshot()
```

3. **Document and Build**:

- Document the package:

```R
devtools::document()
```

- Build and check the package:

```R
devtools::build()
devtools::check()
```

#### Sharing the Project

- **Include `renv.lock`** in version control to share the exact environment setup.
- Other developers can **restore the environment**:

```R
renv::restore()
```

#### Ignoring `renv` Files

- Ensure the following lines are in `.Rbuildignore`:

```
^renv$
^renv.lock$
^renv/activate.R$
```

.gitingore should also include `renv/` to prevent the entire directory from being tracked.

#### Updating Dependencies

- When adding or updating dependencies, always run:

```R
renv::snapshot()
```

This updates `renv.lock` with the current package versions.

By following these notes, future developers will be able to maintain a consistent and reproducible development environment, ensuring smooth collaboration and development.
